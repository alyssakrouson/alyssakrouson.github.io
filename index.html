            <p>My name is Alyssa Krouson. I am a graduate student from the University of Rhode Island where I studied computer science and Japanese.
                Here you can find information about me, my vairous projects I made during my studies, as well as my studies in language and linguistics.

            <p>I grew up in Westwood Massachusetts and graduated from Westwood High School in 2020.
                The following four years, I stayed in Kingston, Rhode Island, and went to the University of Rhode Island.
            </p>  
            <p>After starting my computer science studies, I learned JavaScript, Python, C++, HTML, and CSS (which I used to create this website).
            </p>  
            <p>I began learning Japanese in 2022 and progressed to an intermediate proficiency level.
                In the summer of 2023, I studied abroad in South Korea, where I studied Korean.
                I also studied French for five years in middle school and high school, bringing me to an intermediate high/advanced low proficiency level.
            </p>
            <p>I hope to continue working in web design as well as traveling and learning languages in the years to come.
